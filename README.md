# Debt Freedom Planner
This is my final project for Programming with Functions (CSE 111) at BYU-Idaho.

## Overview
The program aim is to collect user's basic income and debt data to present multiple, customizable plans for total debt repayment or in other words: debt freedom. This will include debt snowball and debt avalanch methods widely recommended by personal finance authors and influencers:

### Debt Snowball
The primary focus of the debt snowball is early success breeds longevity. If you pay off debts quickly, you are more likely to continue on the program until it is complete. This method has you pay off debts from smallest to largest balances, and after each debt payoff, adding what was being paid for the now paid-off debt to the payment of the next. This build-up of funds generates excitement and has been shown to be the biggest factor in continued momentum among those with poor financial habits.

### Debt Avalanch
For those serious about accelerating their way to financial independence as quickly as possible, this uses the same sequential, payment-additive technique as debt snowball but instead prioritizes debts with the highest interest rate first. This ensures more of your money is going toward principle but may leave those with bad financial habits less excitement.

### Customizable Plans
Currently the only available customization is how much additional money to add to the debt payments for the duration of the plan.
